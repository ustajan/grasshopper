# This is a script that runs three simulations and analyzes their outputs as part of a unit test.
# We recommend that the users, after every modification of grasshopper, run this script and compare the outputs for before and after the modification.
# Assuming just procedural (non-physics) modifications the outputs should stay exactly the same.
# After running all the simulations the script prints the following:
# a) md5 sums for the outputs, as well as the md5 sums for PREVIOUS (pre-modification) outputs.  Assuming only minor changes these should match.
# b) output analysis results, as well as the results for the PREVIOUS oututs.  Again, assuming only minor procedural changes the outputs should not change.
